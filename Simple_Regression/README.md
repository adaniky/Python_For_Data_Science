In this kernel, I tried to build a linear three-factor regression model without using the sk-learn library. This was my first model, so do not judge strictly.
At the moment when I done this, I had never programmed on Python before.Thank you for understanding.
I used the pandas and numpy libraries. To determine the regression coefficients, I used the method of least squares.
